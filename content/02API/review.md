### Review 

In this module, we expanded on the previous module, by exploring and learning how to interact with the RESTful APIs on our simple Flask application.  We also spent some time interacting with other popular APIs

- CURL was used to interact with RESTful API
- Postman was used to interact with REST, SOAP and GraphQL API, including the use of Authenticating tokens
- Finally, we learned about API documentation with Swagger.
